A stock price predictor is a tool or model designed to forecast future stock prices based on historical data, market trends, and other financial indicators. These predictors use statistical and machine learning algorithms to analyze past price movements, trading volumes, and a variety of factors that can influence stock prices, such as company performance, economic conditions, and market sentiment.
